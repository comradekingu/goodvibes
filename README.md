Goodvibes Radio Player
======================



Goodvibes is a lightweight internet radio player for GNU/Linux. It offers a simple way to have your favorite radio stations at easy reach.

Goodvibes provides everything you can expect from a modern media player: multimedia keys binding, mpris2 support, notifications, and sleep inhibition. It can be launched with or without GUI, and comes with a command-line client.

Behind the hood, Goodvibes relies on proven and approved open-source libraries: [GLib][] at the core, [GStreamer][] to handle the audio, and [GTK+][] for the graphical user interface.

The project is hosted on Github at <https://github.com/elboulangero/goodvibes>.<br>
The documentation is available at <https://github.com/elboulangero/goodvibes/wiki>.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install Goodvibes is to use an existing package for your distribution. You can check the [release][] pages to see what's available.

If there's no package for you, you will need to grab the source code and compile it. Goodvibes uses the *Autotools* to build, so the procedure is quite straightforward, and should look like this.

	# Get the source code
	git clone https://github.com/elboulangero/goodvibes.git
	cd goodvibes
	# Compile
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	# Install
	sudo make install

Of course, you need to install the required dependencies.

- For the core: `glib`, `libsoup`, `libxml2`, `gstreamer`
- For the UI: `gtk+`, `libkeybinder`, `libnotify`

To install all the dependencies under Debian, run:

	sudo apt install build-essential autoconf autopoint
	sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev libsoup2.4-dev libxml2-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
	sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libkeybinder-3.0-dev libnotify-dev

For more details, please refer to the `configure.ac` file.
