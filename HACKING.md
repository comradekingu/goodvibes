Download
--------

To get the latest source, clone the repository from GitHub.

	git clone https://github.com/elboulangero/goodvibes.git

Some additional resources are handled with git submodules for convenience. They are not needed for the build, but in case you're curious you can get it with the following commands.

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

You can pull the latest changes in each submodule anytime.

	git submodule foreach 'git pull --rebase && git checkout master'

Among the submodules, you will find the wiki, which can be handy if you want to grep it.



Compilation
-----------

Goodvibes uses the `autotools` as a build system. The procedure to compile is the usual one.

        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure
        make

If you want the build to be more verbose, invoke `./configure` as such.

        ./configure --enable-silent-rules

Goodvibes build is quite modular. Features that require an external library are compiled only if the required dependencies are found on your system. Otherwise they're excluded from the build.

You can change this behavior though. You can force a full-featured build, that will fail if some of the required dependencies are missing.

        ./configure --enable-all

Or you can do the opposite, and force a minimal build with none of the optional features enabled.

        ./configure --disable-all

On top of that, you can explicitly enable or disable any optional features, using the `--enable-FEATURE` or `--disable-FEATURE` options (and replacing *FEATURE* with a feature's name). Such parameters take precedence over the `--enable-all` and `--disable-all` options.

For example, to have a minimal build with only the UI enabled:

        ./configure --disable-all --enable-ui

To have a full-featured build but disable notifications:

        ./configure --enable-all --disable-notifications

Notice that disabling the UI will also disable all the UI-related features.

For more details, please have a look into the file [configure.ac](configure.ac), or run:

        ./configure -h



GSettings and DConf
-------------------

First and before all, are you stuck with this error message ?

	[GLib-GIO] Settings schema 'com.elboulangero.Goodvibes.Core' is not installed

Goodvibes uses GSettings and DConf to handle its configuration, and it makes it a bit tricky.

[GSettings][] is part of GLib, and is the component in charge of handling the application settings. If Goodvibes is not installed, launching it will fail because GSettings doesn't find the schema file. So you need to tell the schema location explicitly, using an environment variable.

	# Export once and for all
	export GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR=./data 
	# Now it works !
	./src/goodvibes
	# GSettings comes with a nice command-line tool
	gsettings monitor com.elboulangero.Goodvibes.Core

[DConf][] is the backend for GSettings. It's possible to play directly with the `dconf` command, therefore by-passing completely GSettings.
	
	dconf watch /com/elboulangero/Goodvibes/
	dconf reset -f /com/elboulangero/Goodvibes/

Program Invocation
------------------

To get a brief overview of the command-line options available, invoke with `-h`.

The option you will use the most is `-l` to change the log level. Here is a typical line:

	./src/goodvibes -l trace

Colors are enabled by default, but you can disable it with `-c` if it hurts your eyes. Colors are automatically disabled when logs are redirected to a file.

Logs are all sent to `stderr`, whatever the log level.

Internally, we use the GLib to ouput log messages. For more details, refer to:

- [GLib Message Output and Debugging Functions][]

Some of the libraries we use provide additional command-line options. To see them all, invoke with `--help-all`. For more details, refer to:

- [Running GLib Applications][]
- [Running GStreamer Applications][]
- [Running GTK+ Applications][]

Hardcore GTK+ debugging can be done with [GtkInspector][]:

	./src/goodvibes --gtk-debug=interactive

Code Overview
-------------

Goodvibes is written in C/GObject. The code is heavily object-oriented, and if you're not familiar with GObject, you will have to accept that some magic is going on, here and there. Good luck with that ;)

The code is neatly split into different parts:

- `additions`: this is where I extend some of the libraries I use, where I add some functions that I wish would exist already.
- `framework`: the name says it all.
- `core`: the core of Goodvibes, basically enough to have the software up and running, without the ui.
- `ui`: the GTK+ user interface.
- `feat`: features that can be enable/disabled at compile-time. I guess it's quite similar to the plugins you often find in music players on GNU/Linux. Except that I didn't dare to call it plugin, for plugins are usually something discovered and loaded at run-time, not compile-time.
- `libcaphe`: a library to handle system sleep inhibition.

I suggest to have a look at [configure.ac](configure.ac) and [src/Makefile.am](src/Makefile.am) for more details.



Coding Style
------------

Coding style matters to me. I keep the codebase as clean and neat as possible. I'm a bit of a maniac about that, I tell you.

#### Indentation

The code is currently indented using [Artistic Style][]. There's a script to automatically indent the whole thing:

	./scripts/code/indent.sh all

You can (and should) also indent your staged changes before commiting:

	./scripts/code/indent.sh staged

[artistic style]: http://astyle.sourceforge.net/

#### Comments

For comments, always use C style (aka `/* ... */`).

#### Codetags

For codetags, always use C++ style (aka `//`).

Here are the codetags in use here:

- `WISHED` Things I wish, but will probably never do.
- `TODO`   Things that should be done pretty soon.
- `FIXME`  For things obviously broken.

Always try to make it a one-liner if possible, or at least describe the problem in one line, then add more details on the following lines.

Stick to these conventions, and then getting lists of things is easy:

	# TODO list
	ack 'TODO'
	# List everything
	ack '// '

Here are some links that discuss codetags:

- <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0350/>
- <http://stackoverflow.com/q/1452934/776208>

#### GObject C Files Layout

If you find yourself writing a new file, therefore creating a new object, you might want to use a script that generates all the boilerplate.

	./scripts/code/gv-object-make.sh

Have a look at the structure of the C file created, and please notice a few things.

Functions are ordered from low-level to high-level, to avoid the need of declaring functions before defining it. So basically, you read the file from bottom to top.

Functions are grouped in sections, titled by a comment such as:

	/*
	 * Section name
	 */

Most of the time, these sections are always the same, because implementing a GObject always boils down to the same thing, more or less: GObject inherited methods, property accessors, signal handlers, public methods, private methods, helpers. Sometimes we implement an interface, and that's all there is to it. So I try to show this consistent layout and this simplicity in the C file, and to have it always the same way, instead of throwing code in a complete mess.

If you stick to these conventions, then it's easy to find your way in the code: whatever file you're looking at, they all look the same.



Contribution
------------

Contributing is better done through Github, so please follow the usual Github workflow:

- have your account setup
- fork the project
- work on your own version
- discuss the changes, and eventually submit a merge request

If you hack around for your own use-case, and think that other users could benefit from your hacks, feel free to share it and discuss it on Github.

If we decide that your hacks should be integrated upstream, then you will have to transform it in proper commits, make sure it fits into the current design, that it respects the coding style and so on.

Please note that my first goal for Goodvibes is to ensure a long-term maintenance. There are more than enough software with a short lifetime around, and I don't want to add another to the list. It means I want the code to be clean, readable, maintanable. Clean design and zero hacks are my goals. Dirty hacks are OK to solve a problem quickly, or to demonstrate a possible solution. But they are not OK for long-term maintenance, and therefore won't make it upstream.
